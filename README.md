# Welcome to my assignment B1 repo
This repo contains files and code pertaining to **STAT545A**, a statistics course at UBC. **Assignment B1** covers making a function in R, documenting it, and testing it. 

## My function: `basic_stats()`
Produces basic summary statistics (mean, median, range, sample size) based on levels of a specified grouping variable (e.g. stratified summary statistics). 

### Here's what you need to know:
* `b1_function.md` contains all the code and outputs relevant to the assignment including the function, its documentation, some examples, and testing.
* `b1_function.Rmd` is the file used to generate the `.md`.
* `assignment-b1-andrewfullerton.Rproj` contains the project-specific settings that you'll need to easily reproduce everything on your local machine.
* `.gitignore` is just in place to stop me from uploading unneccessary files to GitHub.

### To poke around:
1. If you only want to view my code, then go ahead and open `b1_function.md` - everything you need is there.
2. If you want to run my code on your local machine, then you'll want to clone the repo and crack `b1_function.Rmd` open in *RStudio*. You can clone the repo using the following git command: `git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b1-andrewfullerton/edit/main/README.md`.
